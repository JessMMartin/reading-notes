# Growth Mindset #

*Hello Everyone. My Name is Jess & welcome to my coding journey!*

A Growth Mindset is a belief in your own talents and development.
Though you may not be good at something at the moment with hard work, knowledge and nurture you have the ablity to learn and with time and effort you can achieve the goals you set.
Ways you can encourage a Growth Mindset:

* Squash your inner saboteur
* Accept failure as a lesson
* Ask for feedback from peers and tutors
* Challenge yourself out of your comfort zone
