## A poem. 

HTTP sources things from the web, <br>
Asks the server for the website address, <br>
The server approves, sends some packets back through, <br>
then the browser takes care of the rest! <br>

### Describe how HTML, CSS, and JS files are “parsed” in the browser.

<p>The first file that the browser reads is the HTML file, and this makes the browser find any < link >-elements that point to external CSS files and any < script >-elements that point to JS files. The browser then asks the server for these files and reads them too. The order of reading these files can change depending on how they are written in the HTML file, but usually, the browser tries to read and run them as fast as possible.</p>

 ### 🌟 How can you find images to add to a Website?

<p>You can either download the immage from the internet. or copy the image location address for later. </p>

<p>A number simply doesn't have any quotes around them.</p> 

### 🌟 What is a Variable and why are they important in JavaScript?

<p>A variable is a container that stores data. They are important as they help webpages be more dynamic, like change an image or make a personalised greeting</p>

### 🌟 What is an HTML attribute?

<p>An attribute is an element that can be added to the code like Id, style or script. It allows the HTML to store info about the CSS or Javascript but can do other things also.</p>

### 🌟 Describe the Anatomy of an HTML element.

### ✨ What is the most important question to answer when designing a Website?

<p> The most important question is what are your end goals?</p>

### ✨ Why should you use an < h1 > element over a <span> element to display a top level heading?

<p>Because by default most browser's user agent stylesheet will style H1 with a large fonr size but < span > has no semantic value, so it will not get any extra benefits.
  
### ✨ What are the benefits of using semantic tags in our HTML?

<p>Some benefits include making text more readable, accessable to people with disabilities, to bbost your pages SEO, customise text and inherit default styles from browsers, such as font size and weight, which can save you time and code.</p>
