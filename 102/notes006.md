# Programing With Javascript

<ol>
    <li>What is control flow?</li><br>
    <p>Control Flow is the sequence of statements that run in a program. It is like a list of commands that tell the computer how and when to do something. In JavaScript, Control Flow is essential for making choices and repeating tasks based on certain conditions.<p><br>
    <li>What is a JavaScript function?</li><br>
    <p>A function is a “subprogram” that can be used by other parts of the code (or by itself, in the case of recursion). A function has a series of statements that make up the function body. A function can receive values as parameters, and the function will give back a value.</p>
    <li>What does it mean to invoke - or call - a function?</li><br>
    <p>One possible way to reword the paragraph is:
    Function invocation is the act of running the code inside a function by using its name and parentheses. You can invoke a function in different ways, such as directly, indirectly, or with the new operator. The way you invoke a function can also change the value of this inside the function.
    <p>You can invoke a function directly by using the function name followed by parentheses that can have arguments. For example, if you have a function named sayHello, you can invoke it directly like this:</p>
    
   `sayHello(); // Direct invocation`<br>

<li>What are the parenthesis () for when you define a function?</li><br>
    <p>The parentheses () in a function definition are used to indicate the parameters that the function can receive as input . Parameters are variables that can store the values that are given to the function when it is called .<p>
