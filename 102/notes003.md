<li>What is HTML and why do we use it?</li>
    <br>

HTML is a type of code that you can use to format a web page and its content. For example, you can make content appear as paragraphs, bullet points, images, or data tables using HTML.
<li>What are the 3 main parts of an HTML element?</li> <br>
<p>You can create an HTML element with a start tag, an end-tag, and some content.
</p>
<li> What is it called when you give an element extra information?

<br>
It is called an Attribute. 

<br>

<p>HTML attributes are more information that you can give to an HTML element to change how it functions or looks. For example, you can use an attribute to make a link lead to a different web page, or to make an image present a different image. Attributes are written inside the opening tag of an element, and they have a name and a value. 
<li> What is a semantic element?

<br>
<p>A semantic element is a code element that uses words to show what it contains, in human language. For example, the < header > element means that it has a header, and the < nav > element means that it has a navigation menu. Semantic elements help the browser and the developer know what the content is and what it does. Semantic elements also make it easier to change how the content looks and works with CSS and JavaScript. </p>
