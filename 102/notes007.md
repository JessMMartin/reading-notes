# Operators and Loops

    <li>What is an expression in JavaScript?</li><br>
    <p>An expression in JavaScript is a code snippet that can be calculated and produces a single value. It can be made of literals, variables, operators, and other expressions. There are different kinds and types of expressions, such as primary expressions, left-hand-side expressions, unary expressions, arithmetic expressions, relational expressions, and more.
    <li>Why would we use a loop in our code?</li><br>
    <p>Loops are a way of running a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is satisfied . Loops are helpful for doing tasks that need multiple steps, such as calculations, data processing, or drawing shapes . Loops can make the code faster and easier by avoiding code duplication and making the code more modular and maintainable .<p>
    <li>When does a 'for' loop stop executing?</li><br>
    <p>The 'for' loop will stop executing once a condition is met
    <li>How many times will a 'while' loop execute?</li><br>
    <p>The condition and the body of the loop determine how many times a 'while' loop will run . The loop will not run at all if the condition is false from the start. The loop will run forever if the condition is always true, unless there is a break statement inside the loop that ends it . The loop will run until the condition turns false if the condition depends on the body of the loop .
