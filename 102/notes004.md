    <li>What is the purpose of CSS?

  <ul><br>
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a language that lets you style and format how HTML elements look on a web page.</li>
        <li>CSS works by applying rules to HTML elements that match certain criteria, such as their type, class, id, or position. CSS rules have a selector, which identifies the elements to be styled, and a declaration block, which contains the style properties and values for the elements.</li>
        <li>
        The purpose of CSS is to provide a standard way to define, apply, and manage styles for web pages. CSS has many advantages over using HTML alone to style web pages, such as separating the presentation from the content, applying consistent styles across multiple web pages, giving more control and flexibility over how HTML elements are displayed, and following a hierarchical scope of effect.</Li>
    </ul><br>

<li>What are the three ways to insert CSS into your project?
    <ul><br>
        <li>Inline CSS - Inline CSS is the CSS code that is written inside the HTML tag.</li><br>
        <li>Internal CSS - Internal CSS is the CSS code that is written inside the HTML file in the < style > tag.</li><br>
        <li>External CSS - External CSS is written in a separate CSS file and is included in the HTML file using the < link > tag.</li><br>
    </ul><br>

<li>Write an example of a CSS rule that would give all < p > elements red text. <br>

    p { color: red; }

This rule has a selector (p) that matches all paragraph elements, and a declaration block ({color: red;}) that specifies the style property (color) and value (red) for the elements. This rule would make the text inside all < p > elements appear red on the web page .
